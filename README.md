I2PRemoteControl
================

Remote control application for I2P router for Mac OS X

Prerequisites
================

"I2PControl" plugin has to be installed on the i2p node you want to control.

Plugin is available at: http://itoopie.i2p/files/I2PControl.xpi2p

To install the plugin, open the i2p console in the browser, e.g.: “http://localhost:7657/configclients”, then enter the plugin URL in the "Plugin Installation" field on the bottom of the web page, click "Install Plugin" and wait until installation is finished.

PS. If you are having troubles downloading the plugin then check whether your router does know itoopie.i2p eepsite address. If not, open itoopie.i2p in the browser and follow usual steps to find out and save itoopie.i2p site address into router’s address book (use one of the available jump services like i2host.i2p or stats.i2p).
